This next topic covers licensing. MySQL licensing is essential for independent software vendors. They're called ISVs. In original manufacturers, they're called OEMs. This is because these companies often incorporate MySQL code into their software products or hardware system to boost the functionality and performance of their product. MySQL licensing is equally important for value-added resellers. We call those VARs. And also, it's important for other distributors.

These groups bundle MySQL with other commercially licensed software to sell as part of their product offering. The GPL v. 2 license might suit Open Source products, Open Source projects that distribute their products under that license. But many ISVs, OEMs, and VARs prefer not to create Open Source products and make their source publicly available. They usually want to keep their code private. This is why Oracle provides a commercial licensing option. This license allows businesses to use MySQL in their products without having to disclose their source code as required by GPL v. 2.

In summary, MySQL licensing offers choices to businesses. They can make their product code public or maintain proprietary control over their product.
