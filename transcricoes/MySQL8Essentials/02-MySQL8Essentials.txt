In this module, we will talk about MySQL Enterprise Edition. We'll dive into the Oracle MySQL ecosystem and explore its various components. We'll first explain what MySQL is, and then we'll talk about the different licenses you can get for MySQL. After that, we'll check out the available support services for MySQL users. Then we'll give a quick overview of the tools and features MySQL has.

Finally, we'll explore how HeatWave, the MySQL Cloud version, operates. Let's go ahead and get started. MySQL is a relational database management system that organizes data into structured tables, rows, and columns for efficient programming and data management. MySQL is transactional by nature. When storing and managing data, actions such as selecting, inserting, updating, or deleting are required.

MySQL groups these actions into a transaction. The transaction is saved only if every part completes successfully. MySQL is a high-performance database that uses its default storage engine, known as InnoDB. InnoDB helps MySQL handle complex operations and large data volumes smoothly.

MySQL works well with online transaction processing workloads. It handles transactions quickly and manages large volumes of transaction at once. OLTP, with low latency and high throughput, makes MySQL ideal for high-speed environments like banking or online shopping. MySQL not only stores data but also replicates it from a main server to several replicas.

It improves data availability and load balancing, which is crucial for businesses that need up-to-date information. MySQL replication supports read scale-out by distributing queries across servers, which increases high availability. MySQL is the most popular database on the web, and there are several reasons.

First, it is a relational database management system that supports SQL. It also works as a document store, enabling the creation of both SQL and NoSQL applications without the need for separate NoSQL databases. Additionally, MySQL offers advanced security features to protect data integrity and privacy.

It also uses tablespaces for better disk space management. This gives database administrators total control over their data storage. MySQL is simple, solid in its reliability, and secure by design. It is easy to use and ideal for both beginners and professionals. MySQL is proven at scale by efficiently handling large data volumes and high transaction rates.

MySQL is also open source. This means anyone can download and use it for free. Users can modify the MySQL software to meet their needs. However, it is governed by the GNU General Public License, or GPL. GPL outlines specific rules for its use. MySQL offers two major additions. For developers and small teams, the Community Edition is available for free and includes all of the core features needed.

For large enterprises, the Commercial Edition provides advanced features, management tools, and dedicated technical support. Let's look at some of the key commercial products offered by MySQL. MySQL Standard Edition offers a robust database management system with full transactional support. It is ideal for medium-sized businesses. The Standard Edition features are common to all editions.

These features, the one that we are highlighting right now, are available in the Community Edition but fully supported in the Enterprise Edition. You will need an Enterprise Edition license to get support for any of these features. The following features are for MySQL Enterprise Edition only. This is the most comprehensive edition of MySQL.

And let's remember, it also includes all of the features of the Standard Edition version and the extra Community features we just spoke about earlier. The last two features are exclusive to the MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition. It is designed for critical applications. This edition offers real-time in-memory access with consistent-- repeat. This edition offers real-time in-memory access with consistent transactions across partitioned and distributed data sets.

Its exclusive features are MySQL NDB, which stands for network database, and MySQL Cluster Manager. In this section, we will look at the Oracle MySQL Business model. We'll start with Licensing, where we'll go over all the available options. Then we'll go over Support, where we'll talk about the Oracle 24/7 support that is made available by seasoned MySQL developers.

Tools and Advanced Features are the enhancements that make MySQL robust, and we'll do an overview of those features and tools. And then we'll talk about the Cloud. We'll see how MySQL HeatWave fits into different Cloud-based solutions. Again, let's get started.S
