Now, let's turn to the installation process, where we'll talk about installing MySQL on your operating system. You can install MySQL on various operating system, depending on your needs. These might include several distributions of Linux or Unix, Windows, Mac OS, Oracle Linux based on the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel, Solaris and freeBSD.

As always, the MySQL documentation provides full details on supported operating system. It also provides the specific installation steps for each of the operating system. Plus, it tells you how to perform the initial configuration and further administrative steps. You can find the installation documentation at the link in this slide right here.

If you're installing on Windows, you have a couple of options. First, the MySQL installer utility is the easiest way to install MySQL. It installs MySQL and performs the initial configuration based on options that you choose an installation time. It includes not only the MySQL server, but also the most important connectors, the MySQL Shell Client, MySQL Workbench Client with user interface and common utilities for troubleshooting and administration. It also installs several simple databases and models and documentation. It's the easiest way to install MySQL because it uses an installation wizard. It lets you select your installation target location, what components to install and other options.

Now, for more control over your installation, you can install MySQL from the binary zip archive. This does not include sample or supporting tools and connectors, but only contains the applications binaries, which you can install anywhere you want. This means that the initial configuration is not performed by selecting an option through a wizard. Instead, you must configure the Windows Service and MySQL configuration file yourself.

Linux installation is more varied. This is because of the different distribution and also because of its terms of flexibility. On many distributions of Linux, you can use the package manager native to that distribution. For example, you can use the yum package manager in all Oracle Linux to install RPM files. You can also use a binary archive to install only the files. To decide which method you want to use, it's based on several factors. How much you know about MySQL files and configuration and the operating system on which you're going to do the installation. Any applicable standard or operating procedures within your own company's IT infrastructure, how much control do you need over this installation and how flexible a method do you need? For example, the RPM package for Oracle Linux, it installs the file in specific locations and with a specific service, MySQL user account.

It's also important to realize that some distributions do not install MySQL software when you use the Package Manager to install the package name MySQL or MySQL server. Some distributions use fork versions of MySQL. There are some times somewhat compatible but is not really MySQL software. If that happens, you can easily install MySQL on top of those four versions-- just by connecting the package manager to the official MySQL repositories. MySQL on Linux requires that you have some dependencies installed. These dependencies will be installed by the package manager as a prerequisite. They are libaio used for asynchronous input/output operation in the kernel. Libtinfo used for displaying text in console application.

Linux package managers not only install the binary program files, but also any lower level dependencies that are required along with the configuration files, operating system settings, including user accounts and file permission. Some Linux distributions like Oracle Linux use RPM packages. RPM packages are files that contains the software and instructions for its installation. They are installed with the yum utility, which gets the package from built-in or user-added repositories.

Here are some examples using the yum install command. The first command-- yum install MySQL community server installs the community server and the yum install MySQL Shell install MySQL shell. Other distributions use Deb files and are installed with the app utility. This utility works in a similar way in that it installs from configured repositories. Now the example here uses app install with the same name package from distribution repositories or from repositories that you have added yourself. Every distribution package manager has its own configuration that can include settings about the particular system and where to find repositories for packages. For example, administrators can choose alternative locations for configuration files, such as slush etc, slush my.cnf.

Now, because Enterprise Edition is only available to Oracle customers, there is no publicly available repository for package managers. This means that you must download the package files locally before installing them. If you want to create an entertainment edition repository in your organization, you can do so with a dedicated package that is available for that purpose.

Installing from a package manager is much simpler than installing from binaries and doing all of the configuration manually. This slide shows the standard install location for files and configuration when you install from the RPM package on Oracle Linux. The data files for the initial system, MySQL database and InnoDB log files like undo and redo logs are stored in the data directory slash var slash lib slash MySQL. This is also the default location for any new database that you create. And slash user slash bin for user space binaries, including the MySQL client and other administrative tools. Server wide configuration files are placed in slash etc and slash user with the standard file name my.cnf.

On distributions that use SysVinit, the startup script is placed with other installation scripts in etc in slash-- repeat in slash etc slash init.d. And distribution that use systemd, these files are not required because the package performs the initial startup configuration in a different way. The MySQL error log file is placed in slash var slash log. Bear in mind that this is a human readable text file and is not the same format as the binary logs or InnoDB structural files we spoke about earlier, which are placed in the data directory.

Much of MySQL's behavior is standard and always exists when you install the server. However, you can configure some additional behaviors by extending MySQL with plugins or components. Plugins operate closely with the server and by calling APIs exposed by the server, they add features by providing extra functions or variables. Now, not only do they add variables, they can also interact with the servers on global variables and functions. That makes them work as if they are dynamically loadable parts of the server itself.

Components also extend functionality, but they are separate from the server and extend its functionality through a service-based architecture. You can also extend MySQL in other ways-- by creating stored procedures, triggers and functions with standard SQL and MySQL extensions to that language or by creating external dynamically loaded user-defined functions.
